# This file is used to generating a test key pair for 
# exercising the signing functionality of edx-certificates
# 
# Assuming that you have gpg installed you can generate
# a key with the following command.  This will put the key
# into the keyring of the running user.  This isn't required,
# but is outside the scope of these instructions.

# $ gpg --batch --gen-key test-key.txt
